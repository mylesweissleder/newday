# 🔍 Where to Find Your Railway Project URL

## After Deployment - Railway Shows the URL in 3 Places:

### 1. **Main Dashboard (Most Visible)**
- After deployment completes
- **Large button/link at top** with your app URL
- Usually shows something like: `https://network-crm-production.up.railway.app`
- **This is your Railway domain!**

### 2. **Deployments Tab**  
- Click "Deployments" in left sidebar
- Your latest deployment will show the **live URL**
- Click the URL to test your app

### 3. **Settings → Domains**
- Click "Settings" then "Domains"  
- Shows all domains (default Railway + custom)
- Your **Railway domain** is listed here
