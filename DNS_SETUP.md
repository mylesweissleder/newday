2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Choose root directory
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

## üîç How to Find Railway CNAME Value

1. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to your deployed project
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Domains" section
   - You'll see your custom domain `api.whatintheworldwasthat.com`
   - **The CNAME value will be shown** (like `network-crm-production.up.railway.app`)

## ‚è±Ô∏è DNS Propagation

- **DNS changes take 5-60 minutes** to propagate globally
- **Test with**: https://dnschecker.org
- **Check**: Enter `whatintheworldwasthat.com` and `api.whatintheworldwasthat.com`

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test API (Backend)
```bash
curl https://api.whatintheworldwasthat.com/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}`

### 2. Test Frontend  
Visit: https://whatintheworldwasthat.com
- Should show site access password screen
- Enter: `NetworkCRM2025!`
- Should show login page

### 3. Test Full Application
- Login with: `demo@networkcrm.com` / `demo123456`
- Should see dashboard with contact data

## üö® Common DNS Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"
**Solution**: DNS not propagated yet, wait 30-60 minutes

### Issue: "Site can't be reached"  
**Solutions**:
- Check DNS records are exactly correct
- Verify Railway deployment is successful
- Ensure Vercel deployment is live

### Issue: "CORS Error" in browser
**Solutions**:
- Check API domain in DNS is working
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure backend CORS allows your frontend domain

### Issue: API calls fail
**Solutions**:
- Test API directly: `curl https://api.whatintheworldwasthat.com/health`
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify environment variables in Railway

## üì± Alternative: Use Cloudflare (Recommended)

If your current registrar doesn't have good DNS management:

1. **Keep domain at current registrar**
2. **Change nameservers to Cloudflare**:
   - Sign up at cloudflare.com (free)
   - Add your domain
   - Change nameservers at your registrar to Cloudflare's
3. **Add DNS records in Cloudflare** (same records as above)
4. **Benefits**: Better performance, free SSL, better DNS management
