# Network CRM - AI-Powered Relationship Intelligence

**Proprietary relationship mapping platform for small collaborative teams.**

## What We Built

A collaborative contact intelligence system that transforms scattered professional networks into strategic relationship assets. Uses AI to generate personalized outreach while maintaining shared team visibility.

## Core Value Proposition

**For Small Teams**: You and your collaborators share contact intelligence, relationship history, and network insights. When you import LinkedIn connections, your teammate sees relationship strength indicators. When they add event contacts, you benefit from the expanded network view.

**AI-Powered Personalization**: Generate contextual outreach messages using relationship history, meeting notes, and network connections. No generic templates - every message references specific shared context.

**Relationship Mapping**: Visualize connection strength, interaction history, and mutual relationships across your shared network. See who knows whom, when relationships were formed, and how to leverage warm introductions.

## How It Works

1. **Collaborative Import**: Team members import contacts from LinkedIn, events, CSV files
2. **Smart Deduplication**: System merges duplicate contacts, tracks career progressions, preserves all relationship context
3. **AI Message Generation**: Creates personalized outreach referencing specific meetings, mutual connections, shared interests
4. **Relationship Intelligence**: Maps network connections, tracks interaction history, identifies warm introduction paths
