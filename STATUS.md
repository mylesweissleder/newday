**Session:** Post-Contact Import & Authentication Fixes

## 🎯 Current Major Issues

### 1. **🚨 CRITICAL: Invitation System Not Working**
- **Status:** Under Investigation with Enhanced Logging
- **Issue:** "Send Invitation" button doesn't send requests to server
- **Impact:** Cannot invite new crew members
- **Evidence:** No server logs showing invitation requests despite clicking button
- **Debugging Added:** 
  - Client-side logging: `🚀 CLIENT: Starting invitation request`

- **Next Steps:** Need to check browser console for client-side errors

- **Issue:** Adding tags to contacts results in blank page
- **Impact:** Cannot manage contact tags in bulk

- **Next Steps:** Check browser console for errors, clear cache

### 3. **📧 Email Delivery Not Working**
- **Status:** Configuration Fixed, Still No Delivery
- **Issue:** Invitation emails not being sent despite proper Resend setup
- **Evidence:** Server logs show "✅ Resend initialized with API key" but no email sending activity
- **Configuration:** 
  - Domain: `startuplive.com` (verified)
  - From: `TrueCrew <noreply@startuplive.com>`
  - API Key: Configured and validated
- **Root Cause:** Invitation requests not reaching server (see Issue #1)

### Email Service
- **Status:** ⚠️ Configured but not tested
- **Provider:** Resend
- **Domain:** startuplive.com (verified)

## 🚨 High Priority Bugs to Fix

1. **Invitation System (CRITICAL)**
   - Debug why client requests don't reach server
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Verify client-side form submission logic

2. **Bulk Operations UI (HIGH)**
   - Investigate blank page on tag operations
   - Likely client-side rendering error
   - May need page refresh/cache clear

3. **Email Delivery Testing (MEDIUM)**
   - Once invitations work, test actual email delivery
   - Verify Resend API integration
   - Check spam folders and delivery logs

## 📊 System Health

- **Server:** ✅ Running (port 3002)
- **Client:** ✅ Running (dev mode on localhost:3002)
- **Database:** ✅ Connected with 1,149+ contacts
- **Authentication:** ✅ Cookie-based system working
- **File Operations:** ✅ CSV import working
- **Contact Management:** ✅ Core features working

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Server Logs Pattern
```
✅ Resend initialized with API key: re_2HBde3Y...
🚀 Network CRM Server running on port 3002 (optimized)
📊 Environment: development
🔒 Security features enabled: Rate limiting, Helmet, CORS
📝 Structured logging active
```

### Expected But Missing Logs
```
🎯 INVITE ROUTE HIT - User: [userId] Body: [requestBody]
📧 Attempting to send email to: [email]
🔍 Current user role: [role] Has permissions: [boolean]
```

## 💡 Immediate Action Items

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors when using bulk operations
2. **Clear browser cache** and refresh to ensure latest code is loaded
3. **Test invitation functionality** with browser dev tools open to see network requests
4. **Verify client-server connectivity** for invitation routes
5. **Test email delivery** once invitation system is functional

---

**Summary:** The application core is functional with successful contact management and authentication. The main blockers are UI-related issues preventing bulk operations and invitation functionality from working properly. These appear to be client-side problems rather than server-side API issues.
