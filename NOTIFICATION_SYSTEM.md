# TrueCrew Notification System Design

## Notification Strategy: "Smart but Never Annoying"

### **Immediate Notifications (Real-time)**

#### 1. **Referral Request Created**
```
TO: Facilitator (Contact Owner)
CHANNELS: Email + In-app + Push (if enabled)
TIMING: Immediate

EMAIL SUBJECT: "Alex needs an intro to Sarah Chen at Sequoia"
PREVIEW: "Series A funding for AI startup - can you help?"

ACTIONS: [Make Intro] [Decline] [Ask Questions] [View in TrueCrew]
```

#### 2. **Request Response**
```
TO: Requester
CHANNELS: Email + In-app
TIMING: Immediate when facilitator responds

ACCEPTED: "Great news! Chris will introduce you to Sarah Chen"
DECLINED: "Chris declined the intro request (reason: timing not right)"
```

#### 3. **Introduction Sent Confirmation**
```
TO: Requester + Facilitator
CHANNELS: In-app + Email (optional)
TIMING: When facilitator sends introduction

CONTENT: "Introduction sent! We'll track if a meeting gets scheduled."
```

---

### **Smart Follow-ups (Non-intrusive)**

#### **48-Hour Pending Reminder**
```
TO: Facilitator (if request still pending)
CHANNELS: In-app notification only (gentle)
TIMING: 48 hours after request

CONTENT: "Alex is still waiting for a response about Sarah Chen intro"
ACTIONS: [Quick Accept] [Quick Decline]
```

#### **Weekly Crew Digest**
```
TO: All crew members
CHANNELS: Email (beautiful digest format)
TIMING: Every Monday 9am local time

CONTENT:
- "3 introductions made this week 🤝"
- "2 meetings scheduled from your referrals 📅" 
- "Alex landed a meeting with that VC you introduced! 🎉"
- Pending requests needing attention
```

#### **Success Follow-up**
```

```

## **Notification Preferences (User Control)**

### **Default Settings (Balanced)**
```javascript
{
  // Critical path - always on
  referralRequests: { email: true, push: true, inApp: true },
  requestResponses: { email: true, push: true, inApp: true },
  introductionSent: { email: false, push: false, inApp: true },
  
  // Follow-ups - user controllable  
  pendingReminders: { email: false, push: false, inApp: true },
  weeklyDigest: { email: true, push: false, inApp: false },
  successUpdates: { email: false, push: true, inApp: true },
  
  // Timing preferences
  quietHours: { start: "22:00", end: "08:00" },
  timezone: "auto-detect"
}
```

### **Power User Settings**
```javascript
{
  // Immediate everything
  all_notifications: { email: true, push: true, inApp: true },
  realTimeUpdates: true,
  weeklyDigest: true,
  monthlyReport: true

```

### **Minimalist Settings**

{
  // Only critical notifications
  referralRequests: { email: true, push: false, inApp: true },
  requestResponses: { email: true, push: false, inApp: true },
  weeklyDigest: { email: true, push: false, inApp: false },
