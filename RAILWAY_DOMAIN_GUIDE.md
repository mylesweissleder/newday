# 🚂 Finding Your Railway CNAME Value

## What is the Railway Domain?

When you deploy to Railway, they automatically assign your app a domain like:
- `network-crm-production.up.railway.app`
- `vigilant-seabird-123abc.railway.app` 
- `your-app-name.railway.app`

This is what you use as the CNAME value for `api.whatintheworldwasthat.com`.

## 📍 How to Find Your Railway Domain

### Step 1: Deploy Your App to Railway First

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign in** with GitHub
3. **Create New Project** > **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. **Select your repository** (`newday` or whatever you named it)

### Step 2: Railway Will Assign a Domain

After deployment, Railway automatically gives you a domain. You'll find it:

1. **In the Railway Dashboard**:
   - Click on your deployed project
   - Look for the **URL** at the top of the page
   - It will be something like: `https://network-crm-production.up.railway.app`

2. **Or in the Deployments Tab**:
   - Click "Deployments" 
   - You'll see the live URL there

### Step 3: Get the Domain (Without HTTPS)

If Railway shows: `https://network-crm-production.up.railway.app`

**Your CNAME value is**: `network-crm-production.up.railway.app`
(Remove the `https://` part)

## 🎯 Example DNS Setup

Once you get your Railway domain, your DNS will look like:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: CNAME
Name: api
Value: network-crm-production.up.railway.app
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Deploy First, Get Domain Later

**If you want to deploy now without custom domain**:

1. **Deploy to Railway** with default domain
2. **Test your API** at the Railway URL
3. **Then add custom domain** `api.whatintheworldwasthat.com` later
4. **Update DNS** once you have the Railway domain

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Commands

If you want to deploy via Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway  
railway login

# Deploy from your project directory
railway deploy

# The CLI will show your app URL
```

## 📋 What You'll See in Railway

After deployment, your Railway dashboard will show:
- ✅ **App URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app` 
- ✅ **Status**: Active
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Set correctly
- ✅ **Logs**: Backend running on port 3001

**The domain shown in the app URL is your CNAME value!**

## 🔗 Testing Without Custom Domain

You can test your app immediately using Railway's default domain:

1. **Test Backend**: `https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/health`
2. **Update Frontend**: Temporarily point `VITE_API_URL` to Railway domain
3. **Test Full App**: Deploy frontend to Vercel with Railway URL

**Then switch to custom domain once DNS is ready!**
